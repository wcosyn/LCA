ABOVE 4 THERE WHERE SOME PEAKS IN THE MF CALCULATIONS,
THESE VALUES ARES MANIPULATED (SET TO 0) SO FIGURES DOESNT SHOW THEM


Camille:
File name convention seems to be
dens_ob4.[isospin1][isospin2].[central][tensor][spinisospin].[nucleus].[n1][l1][n2][l2]

Where a value of -1 for n1,l1,n2,l2 means including all orbitals...

I think value of 0 for isospin1 and isospin2 means include all, seems to be correct (see test.py)

What the 4 in dens_ob4 means, no idea...
