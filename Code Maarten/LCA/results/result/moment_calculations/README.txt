Make P2( P ) with selected quantum numbers
All in different files
Results Are Good
The datafiles are P=(k1+k2)/sqrt(2)
The moments are in P=(k1+k2)  (simulate.py transforms the results)
Use momentsX.sh to create moments (uses simulate.py)
Use moments2X.sh is not in use
use plotX.sh to create P_2(P) plots with coloured l-distributions (uses plot.py)
Also plot.py does transformation from P=(k1+k2)/sqrt(2) to P=(k1+k2)
Uses momentsX.gp to make gnuplot figs of the in momentsX.sh created files

Camille: 

Naming of the datafiles is 

hocommon_NN_lS.[nucleus] 

with N in [n,p], l and S is the relative orbital and total spin of the nucleon
pair. A value of -1 means include all.
