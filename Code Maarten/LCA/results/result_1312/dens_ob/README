The projection is done with 
      if( !(E<0) && (2*nA+lA != E || 2*nB+lB != E) ) 

qmax= 3


Problems:
- Sum of E=0,1,2,.. mf part is not equal to total sum?
  Reason: total sum is exact, the selected sum are cut by qmax.
  The correlated part stays the same because corr part in both -1 and E!=-1 calculations
  are limited by the qmax parameter.
  But here, the way the selection is performed can give a difference 
  in the norm of the correlated part in the total distributions (E=-1) and
  the sum of the norms of the correlated parts of the selected distributions.

- How do we now is qmax is big enough for the mf part?
  The total distribution (E=-1) is exact, so the sum of the selected integrals 
  should be close to the mf integral of the total distribution.

- How do we now is qmax is big enough for the correlated part?
  The total sum and the selected sums both depend on same parameter qmax.
  So the same solution as for mf part is not possible.
  But the calculation of the one body norm is exact,
  so the integral should be close to the result form the ob norm.
  There the total distribution is normalized with the calculated ob norm,
  a good qmax for correlated part should give a good normalization of the 
  total (E=-1) distribution (which is independent of effect of qmax on mf
  part in E!=-1 calculations)
