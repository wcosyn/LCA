mf projection is wrong

        if(2*nA+lA != E || 2*nB+lB != E)
        {
          continue;
        }

Instead of

        if(2*nA+lA != E || 2*nB+lB != E)
        {
          preifactor*= 0.5;
        }


and something else (TA == TB if t == 0 )

But the E=-1 results are still correct and can be used for A < Ca48
(for A >= CA48, they are derived as the sum of the projected ones, so not correct)
