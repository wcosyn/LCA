operator_virtual_ob.cpp:

    [200]
        Q: On this line you should return 0 in stead of 1???? Does not make
difference in end result because result is set to zero. 

        A:
    
    [207] operator_virtual_ob::get_spinisospin_me( int la, int l, int S, int J, int T, double* result )
        
        Q : Why passing la,l,J as the result does not depend on these quantum numbers?
        
        A [pending] : maybe some other place some operators are used that do depend upon these and trough inheritance the function must conform to 
                the overriding of the virtual function????
